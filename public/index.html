    <p>I love coding, LLMs, BJJ. I enjoy learning about information compression and game theory. </p>

    <p>My favorite philosophers are Joscha Bach and Michael Levin for providing a mechanistic view of society, answering questions way better than my parents did.</p>

    <p>I've recently gotten into writing because of its capacity for lossless information transfer and asynchronous communication, a trait that I have recently come to value.</p>
